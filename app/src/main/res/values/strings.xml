    An apple is a round, edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus domestica). Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe and were introduced to North America by European colonists. Apples have religious and mythological significance in many cultures, including Norse, Greek, and European Christian tradition.

    Apples grown from seed tend to be very different from those of their parents, and the resultant fruit frequently lacks desired characteristics. Generally, apple cultivars are propagated by clonal grafting onto rootstocks. Apple trees grown without rootstocks tend to be larger and much slower to fruit after planting. Rootstocks are used to control the speed of growth and the size of the resulting tree, for easier harvesting.

    There are more than 7,500 varieties of apples. Different cultivars are bred for various tastes and uses, including cooking, eating raw, and cider production. Trees and fruit are prone to fungal, bacterial, and pest problems, which can be controlled by a number of organic and non-organic means. In 2010, the fruits genome was sequenced as part of research on disease control and selective breeding in apple production.
    Worldwide production of apples in 2021 was 93 million tonnes, with China accounting for nearly half of the total.

    Avocado (persea americana) is a subtropical tree native to Mexico and Central America, classified as flowering, dicotyledon, in the family Lauraceae. People have known to eat avocado fruit since ancient times, as evidenced by people finding an avocado-shaped water bottle in the city of Chan Chan before the Inca era.

    Avocado tree about 20 meters tall, leaves alternate, each leaf 12–25 cm long, flowers inconspicuous, green-yellow, each flower 5–10 mm large.

    The fruit of the avocado tree is like a gourd, 7–20 cm long, and weighs 100 g-1 kg. Shell thin, slightly hard, dark green, sometimes almost black. When ripe, the inside of the meat is soft, light yellow, like butter, with a sweet taste. The avocado pit is egg-shaped, 5-6 cm long, centrally located, dark brown, and very hard.

    An average avocado tree produces 120 fruits a year. Avocado orchards are capable of producing 7 tons of avocados per hectare per year, with gardens reaching up to 20 tons. Avocados are not suitable for growing in cold areas, only growing in tropical and temperate regions.

    Avocado flesh is often used as an ingredient for refreshing smoothies, salads, sushi or can be eaten with bread by spreading it on the cake and sprinkled with a little sugar. In addition, avocado is also used in skin care, but eating a lot of avocado also causes liver disease.

    Coconut (Cocos nucifera) is a species of woody plant, member of the family Arecaceae and the only living species of the genus Cocos. Coconuts are ubiquitous in coastal tropical regions and are a tropical cultural icon. Coconuts provide food, fuel, cosmetics, folk medicine and building materials, among many other uses. The inner flesh of the ripe coconut, as well as the coconut milk that is extracted from it, is a familiar part of the diet of people living in the tropics and subtropics. The coconut fruit is different from other fruits because the endosperm contains a large amount of clear liquid, known as coconut water. Ripe coconuts are used as food, or processed to get coconut oil and coconut milk from the fruit pulp, charcoal from the hard shell and coir from the fibrous shell. The desiccated coconut meat is called copra, the oil and juice extracted from this is often used in cooking - frying in particular - as well as in soaps and cosmetics. Sweet coconut sap can be used as a drink or fermented into coconut wine, coconut vinegar. Hard shells, fibrous husks and long leaves can be used as raw materials to make a variety of interior decoration products.

        Banana is the name of the fruit of the tree species of the genus Banana; This is considered one of the most widely eaten fruits. Banana trees are native to the tropics of Southeast Asia and Australia. Today, bananas are grown throughout the tropics.
        Bananas are grown in at least 107 countries. In many regions of the world and in commerce, "banana" is the word commonly used to refer to soft and sweet bananas. The cultivars with firmer fruit are called leaf bananas. Bananas can also be sliced thin, then fried or baked to eat like potatoes. Dried bananas are also mashed into banana powder.
        The fruits of wild banana trees (also known as wild bananas in Vietnam) have many large and hard seeds. But most bananas that are traded for seeds lack seeds (see seedless fruit) because they have been domesticated for a long time and have triploid chromosomes. There are two basic types of bananas: dessert bananas that are yellow and eaten when ripe, and cooked bananas that are cooked while green. Most of the exported bananas belong to the first category; however, only about 10–15% of total banana production is exported. The United States and countries in the European Union import bananas the most.

    The durian is the edible fruit of several tree species belonging to the genus Durio. There are 30 recognized Durio species, at least nine of which produce edible fruit.[3][4] Durio zibethinus, native to Borneo and Sumatra, is the only species available on the international market. It has over 300 named varieties in Thailand and 100 in Malaysia as of 1987. Other species are sold in their local regions.

    Named in some regions as the "king of fruits", the durian is distinctive for its large size, strong odor, and thorn-covered rind. The fruit can grow as large as 30 cm (12 in) long and 15 cm (5.9 in) in diameter, and it typically weighs 1 to 3 kg (2.2 to 6.6 lb). Its shape ranges from oblong to round, the color of its husk from green to brown, and its flesh from pale yellow to red, on the species.

    Some people regard the durian as having a pleasant sweet fragrance, while others find the aroma overpowering and unpleasant. The smell evokes reactions ranging from deep appreciation to intense disgust. The persistence of its odor transportation, which may linger for several days, has led certain hotels and public services in Southeast Asia to ban the fruit. The 19th-century British naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace described its flesh as "a rich custard highly flavored with almonds". The flesh can be consumed at various stages of ripeness, and it is used to flavor a wide variety of delicious and sweet desserts in Southeast Asian cuisines. The seeds can also be eaten when cooked.

    Dimocarpus longan, commonly known as the longan and dragons eye, is a tropical tree species that produces edible fruit. It is one of the better-known tropical members of the soapberry family Sapindaceae, to which the lychee and rambutan also belong. The fruit of the longan is similar to that of the lychee, but less aromatic in taste. It is native to tropical Asia and China.

    The longan (from Cantonese lùhng-ngáahn 龍眼, literally dragon eye), is so named because it resembles an eyeball when its fruit is shelled (the black seed shows through the translucent flesh like a pupil and iris). The seed is small, round and hard, and of an enamel-like, lacquered black. The fully ripe, fresh shell fruit has a bark-like shell, thin, and firm, making the fruit easy to peel by squeezing the pulp out as if one were cracking a sunflower seed. When the shell has more moisture content and is more tender, the fruit becomes less convenient to shell. The tenderness of the shell various due to either premature harvest, variety, weather conditions or storage conditions.

    1.Botanically speaking, grapes are berries.\n

    2.The slower the grape ripens, the fuller the flavour. Although grapes need a lot of sun to ripen, moderate temperatures ensure a more intense flavour. That is why they also grow in countries like Switzerland and often end up in delicious wine.\n

    3.No wonder the variety of wine is so big: There are about 16000 varieties of grapes worldwide. More than 10000 can be used to make wine.\n

    4.Healthy powersnack: The two ingredients resveratrol and OPC (oligomeric procyanidins) form an almost unbeatable team. They have a positive effect on blood circulation and thus prevent heart and circulatory diseases. But dont forget: a good third of the valuable active ingredients resveratrol and OPC are in the seeds - so those who disdain them get a little less of it. It is similar with the colour: red or blue grapes contain significantly more antioxidants than their light-coloured relatives.\n

    5.Red, White and Rosé: Red wine is made from blue grapes and fermented with the skins so their pigment is released. With white wine, only the juice is fermented and mostly white grape varieties are used for this. Rosé wines are light-coloured wines made from red grapes and are produced in the same way as white wine. With sparkling wine, on the other hand, part of the fermentation process takes place in the bottle. The resulting carbonic acid makes the drink sparkle.\n

    6.Big vs small: The largest area to cultivate vines is in Spain. The region La Mancha is home to the largest wine-growing area in the world. The vineyards cover around 450,000 hectares. The smallest vineyard is located in Vienna. On just 100 square metres, a white wine is grown in Vienna city centre, which is also available for purchase. In a good and productive year, the mini vineyard yields enough grapes to produce 50-60 bottles of white wine.\n
    7.The most expensive wines come from France and Germany: The currently most expensive wine is the "Domaine de la Romanee-Conti Grand Cru, Cote de Nuits" from France. With an average price of more than 15,000 dollars, the red wine relegates the German white wine "Egon Müller Scharzhofberger Riesling" from the Mosel to second place. What is striking in the list of the most expensive wines in the world: Germany and France share the top positions completely. Only in 17th place in the ranking does a third wine country enter the phalanx with the "Screaming Eagle Cabernet Sauvignon" from Napa Valley in the USA. The four German representatives in the top 10 are all white wines, while France convinces with red wines.\n
    8.To make one glass of wine, the juice of about 75 individual fruits is needed. To fill one bottle, the winemaker needs more than one kilogram of grapes.\n
    9.The typical bulge in the bottom of the bottle is called Culot de Bouitelle.\n
    10.Most wines do not get better with age: The older a wine, the better it is: this myth is persistent, but only applies to a small proportion of all types of wine. In fact, more than 90 percent of all wines should be drunk within five years, otherwise they will overripen and eventually taste like vinegar. Only special top wines develop a refined flavour through post-ripening during long storage over many years.\n
